# Airbnb Price Regression

The Project covers analysis of the vital data set “Airbnb Business Case”. Visitors and hosts have been using Airbnb since 2008 to expand travel possibilities and give a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Use LIME and SHAP for model interpretability and predictive modelling to develop market-specific forecasts with various variables. The data used in this research offers information on listing activity and indicators in the United States in 2019. It offers over 210,617 listings and 27 key characteristics, enough to learn more about hosts, geographical availability, and the analytics needed to make projections and draw conclusions.
Airbnb has established their market in accommodation business successfully since 2008 and has provided hosts and visitors with attractive options to visit places across the globe. Using the data collected by Airbnb for their listings, we have employed ML models that predict listing price based on user inputs over the UI. In this process we have used regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to calculate the price from the selective input variables and have used LIME and SHAP for model interpretability. For this project, we have limited the scope of the training data for United States listings only.
